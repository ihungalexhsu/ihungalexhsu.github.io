Event extraction has attracted much attention in recent years due to its potential for many applications. However, recent studies observe some evaluation challenges, suggesting that reported scores might not reflect the true performance. In this work, we first identify and discuss these evaluation challenges, including the unfair comparisons resulting from different assumptions about data or different data preprocessing steps, the incompleteness of the current evaluation framework leading to potential dataset bias or data split bias, and low reproducibility of prior studies. To address these challenges, we propose TextEE, a standardized, fair, and reproducible benchmark for event extraction. TextEE contains standardized data preprocessing scripts and splits for more than ten datasets across different domains. In addition, we aggregate and re-implement over ten event extraction approaches published in recent years and conduct a comprehensive reevaluation. Finally, we explore the capability of large language models in event extraction and discuss some future challenges. We expect TextEE will serve as a reliable benchmark for event extraction, facilitating future research in the field.
